    <h2>Data Structure In Java</h2>

    <p>The term data structure refers to a data collection with well-defined operations and behavior or properties. A data structure is a unique way of storing or organizing the data in computer memory so that we can use it effectively.It is classified in Linear data structures
        and non-linear data structures.</p>
    <h3>Linear Data Structures :</h3>
    <p>In a linear data structure all the elements are arranged in the linear or sequential order. The linear data structure is a single level data structure.</p>
    <h3>Non-Linear Data Structures: </h3>
    <p> The non-linear data structure does not arrange the data in a sequential manner as in linear data structures. Non-linear data structures are the multilevel data structure.</p>
    <p>The need for Data Structures in Java is for Processing Speed, Searching data, Multiple requests at the same time because As the amount of data grows rapidly, applications get more complex, and there may arise the problem. We use Data Structures primarily in almost every field of Computer Science, which is Computer Graphics, Operating systems, Artificial Intelligence, Compiler Design, and many more.</p>
    <h3>Types of Data Structure in Java :</h3>
    <p>Arrays<br>
        Linked Lists<br>
        Stack<br>
        Queue<br>
        Graph<br>
        Set<br><br>
    Arrays : Arrays can have data items of simple and similar types such as int or float, or even user-defined datatypes like structures and objects.<br><br>
    Linked List : A Linked List is a collection of similar types of data elements, called nodes, which point to the next following nodes by means of pointers.<br><br>
    Stack :A stack is a LIFO (Last In First Out) data structure that can be physically implemented as an array or as a linked list. Insertion and deletion of elements in a stack occur at the top end only. An insertion in a stack is called pushing and deletion from a stack is called popping.<br><br>
    Queue: A queue is a FIFO (First In First Out) data structure and we can physically implement it either as an array or a linked list. Whatever way we use to implement a queue, insertions always take place at the “rear” end and deletions always from the “front” end of the queue.<br><br>
    Graph : A set of a finite number of vertices which we call as nodes.An edge with a finite set of ordered pairs which is in the form.<br><br>
    Set : A Set is a special data structure in which we can not use the duplicate values. It is a very useful data structure mainly when we want to store unique elements, for example, unique IDs.<br><br>
