    <h2>Data Structure In Java</h2>

    <p>According to me ,the term data structure refers to a data collection with well-defined operations and behavior or properties. A data structure is a unique way of storing or organizing the data in computer memory so that it can be later used effectively.Data Structures is classified in Linear data structures and non-linear data structures.Personally , i belive that data structures in java is way more interesting.It seems a little hard in the start but trust me it is the most interesting subject i've learned.

    </p>
    <h3>Linear Data Structures :</h3>
    <p>In a linear data structure all the elements are arranged in the linear or sequential order.It is also called as single level data structure.</p>
    <h3>Non-Linear Data Structures: </h3>
    <p> The non-linear data structure does not arrange the data in a sequential manner. Non-linear data structures are also known as  multilevel data structure.</p>
    <p>Java needs data structures for Processing Speed, Searching data, Multiple requests at the same time. Because as the amount of data grows rapidly, applications get more complex, and there may arise the problem. Also data structures are primarily used in almost every field of Computer Science they are Computer Graphics, Operating systems, Artificial Intelligence, Compiler Design, etc</p>
    <h3>Types of Data Structure in Java :</h3>
    <p>Arrays<br>
        Linked Lists<br>
        Stack<br>
        Queue<br>
        Graph<br>
        Set<br><br>
    Arrays : Arrays can have data items of simple and similar types such as int or float, or even user-defined datatypes like structures and objects.The syntax of the array is int arr[] or int [] arr. Also to create new array the syntax is int arr[] = new arr[]. <br><br>
    Linked List : A Linked List is a collection of similar types of data elements, called nodes, which point to the next following nodes by means of pointers.<br><br>
    Stack :A stack is a LIFO (Last In First Out) data structure that can be physically implemented as an array or as a linked list. Insertion and deletion of elements in a stack occur at the top end only. An insertion in a stack is called pushing and deletion from a stack is called popping.For example there are the number of plates arranged in the kitchen so the plate which was last inserted will be out first as the stack definition says.<br><br>
    Queue: A queue is a FIFO (First In First Out) data structure and we can physically implement it either as an array or a linked list. Whatever way we use to implement a queue, insertions always take place at the “rear” end and deletions always from the “front” end of the queue.In queue we can take the example of sales.<br><br>
    Graph : A set of a finite number of vertices which we call as nodes.An edge with a finite set of ordered pairs which is in the form.<br><br>
    Set : A Set is a special data structure in which we can not use the duplicate values. It is a very useful data structure mainly when we want to store unique elements, for example - unique IDs.<br><br>
