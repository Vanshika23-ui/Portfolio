<p>I took a trip to russia during the month of june and trust me russia is so beautiful..But there are lot of preparations you need
    to do before going to russia like planning flight tickets to bus tickets to train tickets to sim cards to luggage and obviously to visa.
    So i travelled to moscow and St.petersburg where the vast majority of tourists who travel to Russia visit there.It is such a peaceful and marvelous
    place.Also it account for around 90% of tourist traffic. This percentage also includes all those who visit the Golden Ring of Russia northeast of Moscow.
    Also there are other tourist destinations are  Kamchatka or Altai, Lake Baikal but are a long distance away. These are attractive 
    destinations but for more adventurous travellers.Also russia is such a big place that around half of india can be shifted there.<br><br>
